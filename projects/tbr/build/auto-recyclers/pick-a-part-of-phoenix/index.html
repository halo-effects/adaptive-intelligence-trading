First and foremost, there is no published price list, which should have sent up warning flags but didn't.  Essentially what happens is you pull the part and then they decide what to charge you, based on how much they think you will pay.  If you look like you are from the burbs,or something other than a bum prepare to pay extra.\r\n\r\nThe first incident occurred on 9/1/2013.  I purchased some transmission parts.  When I got to the counter, the employee looked over what I had and told me my bill was $100.  That seemed a little steep considering I only had 3 master cylinders and a transmission line.  I questioned what everything cost and he explained that the master cylinders were $30 a piece and the trans line was was $5.  I should have put the brakes on right there but I didn't.  Looking at the receipt when I got home, I noticed that the master cylinders were only $20 a piece and that the employee had tacked on a $20 Misc Trans charge for a non-existent part.  Obviously as a way to up-charge me because he thought I'd pay it.\r\n\r\nThe second incident was on 9/4/2013.  I returned to the yard against my better judgment, but this time I had a plan.  I would call from the yard once I had located my parts and request a quote.  I pulled one brake booster and one pedal cluster.  I then called the desk and they quoted me $35 for the booster and $25 for the pedal cluster.  No problem, I took my parts up to the counter where the same employee from the 9/1/2013 incident asked me suspiciously if I had gotten a quote.  I said yes and told him what I had been quoted.  The employee stated that the price on the pedal cluster must have been a mistake because they are $65 not $25.  Now it had taken me an hour of work in 100+ degree temperatures to pull that cluster so for better or worse I wasn't leaving without it.  When I questioned the change in price, the employee huffed and puffed and told me he would sell it to me for $45, $20 more than what I was originally quoted.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, I will never return to this yard and I recommend that other do the same.  The U-Pull and Pay down the road has a published price list and no games, I will be going there from now on.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5","bestRating":"5","worstRating":"1"}},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Tim hartnett"},"datePublished":"2013-03-12","reviewBody":"Tony at the mesa store took cash to have his friend swap an engine he sold me he spoke English when he took cash for the job now a week later the car does not run and he forgot how to speak English is it ok to take cash And not give a reciept","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5","bestRating":"5","worstRating":"1"}},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"JudyPSmith"},"datePublished":"2011-12-16","reviewBody":"They are always helpful, polite and efficient.
