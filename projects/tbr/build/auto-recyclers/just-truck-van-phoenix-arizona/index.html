            <div class="review-text">Just Trucks was awesome...  They were so helpful to me and were able to find all the parts I needed!  PLus, they give standard warranties on thier parts...which I didn't know auto recyclers did.  And...I was able to get a 2 year parts and labor warranty.  The service was great and my truck is running again!</div>

            <div class="review-text">I was recently in a situation where my transmission stopped functioning properly and it was diagnosed with internal failure L The estimate for repairs was just over $3000 – which was WAY MORE than I could afford!  I called around for help, and was given the number to Just Truck and Van. Their Full Service Department got me the part at almost half the cost of new, and with a warranty that was 1 year longer than the new part.  I am so glad I did the research.</div>

            <div class="review-text">I wanted to take a moment to commend the service and quality of Parts provided during my transaction with Just Truck and Van. I recently needed a replacement Motor for my Suburban and was very pleased with the way they handled the transaction. They even helped with getting it installed by recommending a Mechanic to do the work, The Warranties offered were amazing to say the least, I chose the 2 year parts and labor coverage...! I have been driving it for a month now and it runs absolutely like new again...! Thanks guys for all your help I will recommend others...!</div>
