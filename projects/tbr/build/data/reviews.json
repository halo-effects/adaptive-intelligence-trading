    "text": "I was told that my car would be purchased for 500.00 on saturday between 6:30am and noon, also that I would recieve a call one hour prior to pick-up. No call ever came in and no one showed up to complete the deal. Then after several un-successful attempts to reach anybody, I emailed and called, I was sent an offer of 375.00 for my vehicle. If this is the standard practice of this company, I'd advise people to consider all the other recycling yards in the Phoenix area, such as Arizona Auto Parts, Ecology Auto Recycling, or Pick-A-Part. The single most frustrating thing about sellusyourcaronline is that I was asked to wait a 5 1/2 hour span for a call from someone, which never happened. The cooler part of the day was totally wasted. As for the company itself, I can only base their concerns with customers satisfaction with my own experiances. We all know that business' are out to make profits. But to be-little a customer is not acceptable by any means. And to leave the customer stuck waiting for contact, and not following through with that is even more un-acceptable. And finally to put out a lower offer on the same vehicle is just an insult.",

    "text": "I was in a situation where the only way I could get any money for my old car was to sell it for salvage or junk.  I was reluctant but after going around with the MVD one too many times I started contacting all the companies online and in the yellow pages I could find.  Sell us Your Car Online gave me hands down the best price of all of them with no haggling, and the lady in the office, Linda was very patient and kind enough to explain to me how the process worked and why the MVD was not helping me.  She was the first person who listened to the particular issues and worked with me to resolve them and get me the best price for my car.  The day of pick-up, I asked for a call ahead of an hour, the driver Brian, called and told me when he would be there and arrived within a close enough time of that to say they were on time (10 -20 mins which to me, is well within, in fact more than reasonable)  no open ended windows, or calls then one to two hours late.  Brian was very professional, courteous and made something slightly difficult for me (c'mon everyone has been attached to a car for some reason or other in their life - this was mine) very quick and painless.   Papers signed, he paid me and went about his business of loading the car quickly and left.  He also followed up with a quick thank you for your business and have a great day message, which for me put the icing on the cake of a company that is fair and treats their customers with respect, like a real live human being, and still  maintains the highest standards of professionalism and excellent customer service. (which is supposed to be about human beings ..this company gets it!) I would not hesitate to call them if I am in that situation again, and have already told many people about their great service and how easy it was.",

    "text": "I have now had two bad experiences at this yard.  First and foremost, there is no published price list, which should have sent up warning flags but didn't.  Essentially what happens is you pull the part and then they decide what to charge you, based on how much they think you will pay.  If you look like you are from the burbs,or something other than a bum prepare to pay extra.\r\n\r\nThe first incident occurred on 9/1/2013.  I purchased some transmission parts.  When I got to the counter, the employee looked over what I had and told me my bill was $100.  That seemed a little steep considering I only had 3 master cylinders and a transmission line.  I questioned what everything cost and he explained that the master cylinders were $30 a piece and the trans line was was $5.  I should have put the brakes on right there but I didn't.  Looking at the receipt when I got home, I noticed that the master cylinders were only $20 a piece and that the employee had tacked on a $20 Misc Trans charge for a non-existent part.  Obviously as a way to up-charge me because he thought I'd pay it.\r\n\r\nThe second incident was on 9/4/2013.  I returned to the yard against my better judgment, but this time I had a plan.  I would call from the yard once I had located my parts and request a quote.  I pulled one brake booster and one pedal cluster.  I then called the desk and they quoted me $35 for the booster and $25 for the pedal cluster.  No problem, I took my parts up to the counter where the same employee from the 9/1/2013 incident asked me suspiciously if I had gotten a quote.  I said yes and told him what I had been quoted.  The employee stated that the price on the pedal cluster must have been a mistake because they are $65 not $25.  Now it had taken me an hour of work in 100+ degree temperatures to pull that cluster so for better or worse I wasn't leaving without it.  When I questioned the change in price, the employee huffed and puffed and told me he would sell it to me for $45, $20 more than what I was originally quoted.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, I will never return to this yard and I recommend that other do the same.  The U-Pull and Pay down the road has a published price list and no games, I will be going there from now on.",

    "text": "SR Windows &amp; Glass made it easy for me to get my windows and glass doors replaced. I had older dual pane units and some had seal failures and hard water stains from my sprinklers. The new glass looks amazing and they are noticeably cooler. I opted to get the low-e coated glass. Thanks to everyone at SR Windows &amp; Glass for making the process and enjoyable one.",

    "text": "Our customer experience with SR Windows &amp; Glass was excellent from the first office call through the estimator and installer. \r\nAngel (estimator and installer) was an \"angel\".  Courteous, thorough and professional. \r\nWe replaced the parts for 5 windows including two new windows.  The pricing was less than a quarter of what it might have been had we replaced all 4 of the windows including frames. \r\nWe live in Anthem and the windows were installed 17 years ago. SR found the parts within a couple of weeks and a few days later the job was done.",
