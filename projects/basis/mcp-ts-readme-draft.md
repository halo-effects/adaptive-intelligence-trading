# Basis MCP Server

172 tools for the Basis protocol — trading, token creation, prediction markets, staking, loans, vesting, order books, taxes, social, and more. Works with Claude Desktop, Claude Code, and any MCP-compatible client.

The SDK is bundled inside — no separate installation required.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18 or higher
- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) (or any MCP-compatible client)
- A BSC wallet private key

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone & install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Launch-On-Basis/MCP-TS.git
cd MCP-TS
npm install
npm run build
```

### 2. Get a private key

You need a BSC wallet private key. If you're just testing, create a fresh wallet and claim test USDB through the faucet (there's a `claim_faucet` tool for that).

### 3. Add to Claude Desktop

Open your Claude Desktop config:

- **Mac:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Linux:** `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

Add this inside the `"mcpServers"` object (create it if it doesn't exist):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "basis": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/full/path/to/MCP-TS/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "BASIS_PRIVATE_KEY": "0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop. You should see "basis" appear under **Connectors** in the sidebar. If it shows as connected, you're good to go.

### 4. Try it

Open a new chat and ask:

- "What are my balances?"
- "What's the price of STASIS?"
- "Show me active prediction markets"
- "Create a token called DEMO with Floor+ mechanics"

## How It Works

The MCP server wraps the [Basis TS SDK](https://github.com/Launch-On-Basis/SDK-TS) into the Model Context Protocol. The SDK is bundled inside — no separate installation required. Each tool maps to one or more SDK methods, handling:

- **Token resolution** — pass "STASIS" or a raw address
- **Amount conversion** — human-readable numbers (e.g. `50` = 50 USDB) converted to 18-decimal BigInts internally
- **Path routing** — 3-hop swap paths for factory tokens (USDB <> STASIS <> token) built automatically
- **Guardrails** — balance checks before sells, simulation before leverage, vote/claim deduplication
- **BigInt serialization** — all on-chain values safely serialized to JSON

## Using with Claude Code

```bash
claude --mcp-server "node /path/to/MCP-TS/dist/index.js"
```

Or add to your project's `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "basis": {
    "command": "node",
    "args": ["/path/to/MCP-TS/dist/index.js"],
    "env": {
      "BASIS_PRIVATE_KEY": "0xYOUR_KEY"
    }
  }
}
```

## Publishing to npm

```bash
npm publish --access public
```

Then anyone can use it with:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "basis": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@basis-markets/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "BASIS_PRIVATE_KEY": "0xTHEIR_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
