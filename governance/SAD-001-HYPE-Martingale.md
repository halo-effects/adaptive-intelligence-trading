**Status:** ✅ APPROVED & LIVE

**Agent:** Gee Gee

## 1. Strategy Summary

Regime-gated Martingale strategy on HYPE/USDT, executing on OKX DEX via MetaMask wallet. The strategy opens positions only during favorable market regimes (ACCUMULATION, CHOPPY, RANGING) and uses dollar-cost-averaging safety orders to manage drawdowns.

## 2. Capital Allocation

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Total Capital at Risk** | ~300 USDT |
| **Max Loss Tolerance** | 100% (Brett accepts full loss) |
| **Exchange** | OKX DEX |
| **Wallet** | Brett's MetaMask (connected) |

## 3. Recommended Configuration: Conservative

Based on backtesting (60 days HYPE/USDT data), the **Conservative** config provides the best risk/reward for initial live deployment:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Timeframe** | 15m |
| **Take Profit** | TBD (from optimizer results) |
| **Safety Orders** | TBD |
| **Price Deviation** | TBD |
| **Deviation Multiplier** | TBD |
| **SO Volume Multiplier** | TBD |
| **Max Active Deals** | 1 |

> ⚠️ **Note:** Exact parameters need to be filled from the optimizer v2 results (session `swift-mist`). I need to check if those completed.

### Backtest Performance (Conservative, 15m)
- **Total Return:** +122.0% over 60 days
- **Compound Daily:** ~1.34%/day
- **Win Rate:** 100%
- **Max Drawdown:** TBD (from optimizer)

## 4. Risk Controls — Kill Switches

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **Max Drawdown > 50%** | Halt all new deals, alert Brett |
| **Regime = DISTRIBUTION/TRENDING/EXTREME** | No new deals opened |
| **Wyckoff Spring/UTAD detected** | Close all positions immediately, alert Brett |
| **Daily loss > 15%** | Pause trading for 24h, alert Brett |
| **Exchange API errors > 3 consecutive** | Halt and alert |
| **Agent loses connectivity > 30 min** | No new deals (fail-safe) |

## 5. Operational Boundaries

### Agent IS authorized to:
- [x] Monitor market data (prices, orderbook, candles)
- [x] Calculate regime classifications
- [x] Generate and display trade signals
- [x] Send trade notifications to Brett via Telegram

## 6. Execution Method

**KEY QUESTION FOR BRETT:**

How should trades actually execute? Options:

### Option A: Fully Manual
- Gee Gee sends trade signals to Telegram
- Brett manually executes on OKX DEX
- Safest, but requires Brett to be available

### Option B: Semi-Automated via API
- Gee Gee executes trades programmatically via OKX DEX API
- Requires API key setup (governance: never store credentials in plain text)
- Each trade still logged and reported to Brett
- **This requires Tier 3 per-action approval for the initial setup**

### Option C: Smart Contract / Bot
- Deploy a trading bot or use existing DeFi automation
- Most autonomous, highest risk
- Would need extensive review

**Brett's choice:** _______________

## 7. Monitoring & Reporting

- Real-time trade notifications via Telegram
- Daily P&L summary (automated)
- Weekly performance report with regime analysis
- All trades logged to `workspace/trading/live/trade_log.json`

## 8. Duration & Review

- **Initial period:** 7 days
- **Review checkpoint:** After 7 days, assess performance vs backtest
- **Continuation:** Requires explicit re-approval from Brett
- **Termination:** Brett can halt at any time; agent halts on any kill switch trigger
