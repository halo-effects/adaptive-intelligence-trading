## TrustedBusinessReviews.com Migration Project (NEW)
- Brett shared comprehensive migration instructions via Google Doc in Slack #team channel
- **Project:** Migrate TrustedBusinessReviews.com from WordPress to static HTML/CSS/JS
- **Phase 1:** Site migration, review system (PHP backend), admin dashboard, Google JSON-LD schema
- **Phase 2 (future):** SEO/GEO optimization, enhanced schema, Shadow Query listicle/mesh pages
- Full instructions saved: `projects/tbr/migration-instructions.md`
- Design: Deep blue (#1F4E79) + gold (#FFB800), Inter font, mobile-first responsive
- Key constraint: ALL existing URLs must be preserved exactly

## FTP Access
- Server: ftp.networkmarketingmakeover.com:21
- User: ai@trustedbusinessreviews.com
- Initially empty root; Adeel fixed the path ~3:18 AM PST 2/14
- Now points to WordPress document root
- Do NOT store FTP password — use live only

## MAJOR MALWARE DISCOVERY
Found extensive compromise of the WordPress installation:
- `index.php` — replaced with obfuscated Japanese SEO spam + backdoor
- `index.php0` — SEO spam redirector to IP 65.21.235.251 for search bots
- `item.php`, `networks.php`, `options.php`, `pages.php` — password-protected webshells fetching remote code
- `functions.php` (CityDirectoryTheme) — credential exfiltration to `information.cloudsyndication.dev` + RCE backdoor + update suppression
- `.htaccess` — modified to whitelist all malicious PHP files
- `ckk` plugin — fake "Cloudflare Captcha" phishing overlay
- `cf-security-shield` plugin — fake security plugin fetching DNS TXT from racist domain
- `plugin-remover` plugin — attacker tool to wipe legitimate security plugins then install their own
- `e146a/` — malware directory
- `et0lipze/index/` — 1,902 SEO spam doorway pages
- `qq5ce2d1/` — malware directory with webshells

### Cleanup Actions Taken
- Replaced index.php with clean WordPress default
- Replaced .htaccess with clean WordPress rewrite rules
- Cleaned functions.php (removed all malicious code, kept sidebar/menu registration)
- Deleted all webshells (item.php, networks.php, options.php, pages.php, index.php0)
- Removed all 3 malicious plugins (ckk, cf-security-shield, plugin-remover)
- Deleted e146a/ and qq5ce2d1/ directories
- Deleting 1,902 spam pages in et0lipze/ (in progress)
- Recommended password changes for all accounts

- **MALWARE FOUND** in theme's functions.php:
