# 2026-02-14

## Trading Bot Updates
- Long #4 TP hit at $32.086 (+$0.26), Long #5 opened at $32.16
- New base order uses 4% sizing (~$11.58 vs old $5.79) — confirmed working
- Total realized PnL: $1.13 (3 TPs: $0.70 + $0.17 + $0.26)
- Capital increased $292 → $332 (Brett deposited 40 USDT)
- base_order_pct bumped 2% → 4% for better capital utilization
- Capital updated via state.json edit (not restart) to preserve PnL history

## Dashboard Improvements
- Added TP Target column to Trade History
- Added Capital Utilization panel (large donut) — uses exchange `available_balance`
- Added `available_balance` to status.json via new `usdt_available()` API method
- Added Avg Daily ROI card
- Added Open Orders section with projected TP
- Moved charts below Active Trades
- Replaced dual-axis Price/Equity chart with clean Account Value chart
- Renamed SOs → Orders, Aster Dashboard → Automated Trading Dashboard
- Added AI gear icon to header
- Fixed duplicate `const total` JS bug that broke rendering
- Fixed capital utilization showing >100% (capped pending to remaining capital)

## TBR Malware Cleanup (Partial)
- Adeel provided working FTP access (path fixed to WP root)
- Sub-agent scanned and found extensive compromise:
  - functions.php: credential exfil + RCE backdoor → CLEANED
  - index.php, .htaccess: injected → REPLACED with clean versions
  - Webshells (item.php, networks.php, options.php, pages.php, index.php0) → DELETED
  - Malware dirs (e146a/, qq5ce2d1/) → DELETED
  - Fake Cloudflare captcha plugin (ckk) → DELETED
  - SEO spam dir (et0lipze/) with ~1,900 pages → PARTIALLY DELETED (agent timed out)
  - Malicious plugins (cf-security-shield, plugin-remover) → PARTIALLY REMOVED
- Password changes still recommended
- Need another pass to finish cleanup, then start migration audit

## Slack
- Fixed channel ID: C092DGXUZFW (was using wrong C092S0TVA0Z)
- Slack user IDs: Brett=U092S0TJK5X, Adeel=U092D6SA0JW, Gee Gee=U0AFB2EQ21F
- Socket still drops silently — recurring issue
- Communication split: Slack for Halo Effects/Adeel, Telegram for trading/personal

## TBR Static Site Deployed LIVE
- **Site live at https://trustedbusinessreviews.com/** as of ~08:46 PST
- WordPress backed up to `backup_wordpress_20260214/` on server (not deleted)
- 39 business pages, 8 categories, 3 utility pages, 211 reviews migrated
- JSON-LD schema on all listing pages
- **No star ratings exist** — scraped live site, checked REST API + DB, old plugin never stored them. All default to 5★.
- robots.txt needed CHMOD 644 (was locked at 0444)
- Deploy script: `projects/tbr/deploy.js` (takes FTP password as arg)
- FTP: `ai@trustedbusinessreviews.com` @ `ftp.networkmarketingmakeover.com`, explicit FTPS
- **Still TODO:** PHP review API, admin dashboard, contact/get-listed form backends
- Brett's order: scrape ratings → deploy → build review system → build admin system

## TBR Review System Deployed
- Review API, admin dashboard, dynamic review loading all live
- Admin: https://trustedbusinessreviews.com/admin/login.html (admin / TBR-Admin-2026!)
- 211 reviews migrated to flat-file JSON system
- Brett to test admin; then moving to Shadow Query page builds

## TBR Malware — Slack Follow-up
- Messaged Adeel in #team- (C092DGXUZFW) asking for help finishing malware cleanup
- Two options given: (A) SSH/shell access so we can delete server-side, (B) Adeel deletes manually
- Remaining: `et0lipze/` dir (~1,900 spam pages), plugins `cf-security-shield` & `plugin-remover`
- No response from Adeel yet as of end of day

## Dashboard Bug Fix
- Trade History showed Deal #1 (Long, $30.805, TP'd at $31.717) as "OPEN" — confusing
- Root cause: "OPEN" badge was the CSV action type, not deal status
- Fix: added `closedDeals` set tracking TP_HIT deal_ids; OPEN rows for closed deals now show "CLOSED" (gray badge)
- Deal #1 opened Feb 13 03:51 UTC (Feb 12 19:51 PST) — before official "live" but was real

## Trading Bot — End of Day Summary
- Short #3 TP'd at $31.032 (+$0.09), Short #6 opened at $31.092
- Short #6 filled 1 SO at $31.869
- Long #5 still open with 1 SO, avg entry $31.619 — needs $32.09 for TP
- Both sides now have 1 SO each, price ranging $31.2–31.9 all day
- Total realized PnL: $1.22 (4 TPs: $0.70 + $0.17 + $0.26 + $0.09)
- Equity steady at $333.27 (new peak), drawdown 0%
- Regime oscillated: TRENDING ↔ ACCUMULATION ↔ MILD_TREND ↔ RANGING throughout the day

## WhiteHatFX SET Files Analysis
- Brett shared 4 old MT4 SET files from prop firm (FTMO 100k) trading: BTC, currencies, gold, US30
- EA: WhiteHatFX v2 — dual-engine bidirectional grid/Martingale (same concept as Aster)
- Key differences from Aster: 4x lot multiplier (vs 2x), fixed grid steps, fixed hedge ratio (2x), no equity protection
- Gold had trailing stop + break even enabled (only instrument)
- BTC had tight max lot cap (0.3) — hardcoded risk limit
- Brett's view: Aster's regime-based approach replaces hard caps dynamically, prefers staying the course

## Adaptive TP & Deviation — IMPLEMENTED, READY TO DEPLOY
- Brett requested dynamic TP + SO deviation scaling based on ATR/volatility + regime
- Rationale: tight ranging days (like today, $31.05-$31.90 = 2.7% range) waste cycles with 1.5% fixed TP
- Aster fees confirmed: **Maker = 0% (free), Taker = 0.04%** — fees not a blocker for tighter TPs
- **Adaptive TP**: scales 0.6–2.5% based on 14-period ATR + regime multipliers, ATR_BASELINE=0.8%
- **Adaptive Deviation**: scales 1.2–4.0% with own REGIME_DEV_MULT (wider in trending/extreme, tighter in ranging)
- **Hard floor**: deviation always ≥ TP × 1.5
- Regime multipliers: RANGING=0.85×TP/0.80×DEV, TRENDING=1.20×TP/1.30×DEV, EXTREME=0.70×TP/1.50×DEV
- SO orders cancelled and re-placed when deviation changes significantly (>0.15%)
- Dashboard updated with Adaptive TP card showing live TP%, DEV%, ATR%, multipliers
- Code syntax verified clean — deployed and running live as of ~19:38 PST
- Brett thinking about a name for this approach (suggested: "Breathing Grid", "Aster Pulse", etc.)

## Adaptive System — First Live Results
- Short #6 TP'd immediately on restart at $31.265 for +$0.38 (+1.1%) — adaptive system already cycling faster
- ATR was 0.28% (well below 0.8% baseline), so TP tightened to 0.60%, Dev to 1.20%
- **Margin incident**: adaptive deviation tightened SOs, Long SO#2 filled fast, used too much capital
  - Long TP order couldn't be placed (margin insufficient, $52 available, needed $81+ for 2.59 qty sell)
  - Root cause: net position mode — selling 2.59 to close long would flip net short, requiring margin
  - Fix: manually cancelled 3 deep Short SO orders (SO#3/4/5) to free margin → balance jumped to $159 → TP placed successfully
  - Lesson: need margin-aware order placement

## Margin-Aware + TP Analysis — IMPLEMENTED, AWAITING RESTART
- **Margin-aware ordering**: checks available balance before placing SOs, skips what can't be covered
  - `MARGIN_RESERVE_PCT = 0.10` — keeps 10% of capital as safety buffer
  - `_ensure_tp_margin()` — cancels deepest SOs to free margin for TP if needed
  - TP always has priority over SOs — the margin incident can't recur
  - Emergency fallback: cancel ALL SOs if TP still can't place
- **TP-hit analysis**: formatted log block on each TP hit
  - Shows duration, SOs filled, adaptive TP%/Dev%/ATR%, regime, human-readable insight
  - trades.csv extended with 5 new columns: duration, tp_pct, dev_pct, atr_pct, analysis_note
  - Telegram messages include duration and TP%
- Code syntax verified clean — awaiting restart

## Evening Session — Dashboard & Product Page
- Capital now auto-syncs to equity each cycle (compounds with profits + deposits)
- Product name decided: **Adaptive Intelligence Trading (AIT)**
- GitHub account created: `halo-effects` (geegee@haloeffects.net)
- Product page live: https://halo-effects.github.io/breathing-grid/
- Dashboard v2.0 overhaul:
  - New title: "Adaptive Intelligence Trading"
  - Animated breathing grid SVG logo
  - New "Adaptive Intelligence" panel (regime, TP/Dev meters, ATR, multipliers, fees)
  - New "System Features" section (6 differentiator cards)
  - Trade History pagination (10/25/50/100 per page with prev/next)
  - Removed redundant Adaptive TP card (replaced by new panel)
  - Cleaned trades.csv spam (deals 8-56 from restart bug)
- Firebase auth completed but project creation failed (TOS + permissions); pivoted to GitHub Pages
- GitHub PAT created: `openclaw-deploy` (repo scope, 30-day expiry)

## Key Decisions
- Brett: "Slack for Halo Effects, Telegram for trading and other projects"
- TBR malware not critical (Halo Effects owned site, not client) but still cleaning
- 4% base order for better capital utilization on $332 balance
- Adaptive TP/deviation = next evolution of the strategy; optimize for profit through faster cycling
