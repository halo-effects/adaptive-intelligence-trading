## Orderbook Depth (Aster DEX)

- **Best Ask:** $0.6691 (735 BERA)
- **Spread:** $0.0002 (0.030%) — **Very tight, excellent**

## Regime Analysis

BERA's regime distribution over 14 days:
- **Accumulation:** 37.3% — dominant regime, ideal for DCA
- **Mild Trend:** 21.9%
- **Trending:** 21.2%
- **Ranging:** 7.8%
- **Extreme:** 5.7% — slightly elevated, watch for volatility spikes
- **Distribution:** 3.5%
- **Breakout Warning:** 2.7%

**Assessment:** The high Accumulation % is exactly what DCA bots thrive in. The 21% trending is manageable with safety orders.

## Backtest Quality

- **79 deals in 14 days** (5.64/day) — high deal frequency, good compounding
- **100% win rate** with max DD of only -1.38% — conservative and reliable
- **10.13% total profit** over 14 days — strong
- **Profit factor:** Infinity (no losses)

## Volume Assessment

- 24h estimated volume: ~$3M (from T1 scan)
- Orderbook shows real resting liquidity, not just wash volume
- Balanced bid/ask depth suggests organic market making

## Red Flags

1. **Infinite profit factor** — 100% win rate over 14 days is suspicious in backtesting. Could mean the backtest parameters are very conservative (low TP, many SOs). Real trading may see losses the backtest didn't.
2. **Short history** — BERA is relatively new. 14 days of backtest data is the minimum. Would prefer 30+ days.
3. **Extreme regime at 5.7%** — higher than HYPE's 3.8%. May see occasional sharp moves.
4. **$3M daily volume** — adequate but not deep. Slippage could be an issue with larger position sizes.

## Verdict

**✅ SIGNAL IS VALID — Proceed with rotation to BERA/USDT**

The 2x daily ROI improvement with lower drawdown is compelling. The tight spread and balanced orderbook confirm real liquidity. Start with a conservative position size and monitor for 48h before scaling up.
