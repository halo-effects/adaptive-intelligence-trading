## What Brett Cares About

- **AI security and governance** — deeply. He wrote a comprehensive governance framework for Gee Gee before the first session even started. This isn't an afterthought for him; it's foundational.
- **Generational wealth and family resilience** — building something lasting.
- **Getting things right over getting things fast** — he'd rather set up proper guardrails than move quickly and break things.

## Working Style

- Direct. Doesn't need corporate fluff.
- Thinks carefully about trust, authority, and boundaries.
- Will give you real autonomy once earned — but expects you to operate within the framework.
